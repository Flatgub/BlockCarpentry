# BlockCarpentry 
![GitHub last commit (branch)](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/Flatgub/blockcarpentry/dev?label=last%20dev%20commit)

A fork of PianoManu's BlockCarpentry. PRs likely won't be created upstream due to personal religious differences but 
upstream developers are more than welcome to adapt or take wholesale any code from here that they want.

### Current differences from Upstream:
* Major internal refactor (2000+ lines changed, still ongoing...)
* Placing framed blocks with a block in the offhand automatically places the framed block with that mimic already applied
* Various bugfixes.
* More in progress...
